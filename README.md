### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer from Mumbai, India. I can develop a web, mobile, and desktop application and lift 110kg in deadlift. My interests lie in learning new technologies, trying out pc games, cooking and exercising. This page is best viewed on a dark theme ðŸ˜„.

- ðŸ”­  &nbsp; Iâ€™m currently working on a very cool project which I'll add here very soon... probably...
- ðŸŒ±  &nbsp; I want to learn to fly a plane. Blame the new Microsoft Flight Simulator for the interest.
- âœ¨  &nbsp; Games that I currently play: Forza Horizon 4, Ghostrunner and Cyberpunk 2077.
- âš¡  &nbsp; Fun fact: Bears, beets, Battle Star Galactica

Here are my stats
